# Phase 4 setup check: "will my processor run in the autograder's setup?"
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check_design.sh <name> [submission_dir]
#
#   <name>            directory name for this run; everything lands in
#                     phase_4/output/submissions/<name>/
#   [submission_dir]  design to check; defaults to source/reference/
#
# THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT GRADE AND DOES NOT CHECK CORRECTNESS. It answers one
# question: does your design instantiate, compile, reset, retire instructions
# and halt under the same harness shape the autograder uses? It runs a
# ~10-instruction program and never compares a single computed value against
# an expected one. A design can pass this and still be completely wrong.
#
# Use scripts/student_test.sh (the recorded ~24k-vector trace) to find out
# whether your processor is actually CORRECT. Run this one first: if your
# design can't even get through this, the trace check's output will be noise.
#
# Why this exists: the autograder decides pass/fail by parsing the text its
# testbench prints. Debug output left in your own RTL ($display, $write,
# $monitor) is interleaved into that text and corrupts it, which silently
# deletes instructions from the trace the grader sees -- a correct processor
# scoring zero. The bulk trace self-check compares signals inside Verilog and
# never parses text, so it cannot detect this. This script can.
#
# It needs iverilog and nothing else -- no python, no ece552. If iverilog is
# not on your PATH, either put it there or set IVERILOG to the binary:
#
#   IVERILOG=/opt/iverilog/bin/iverilog scripts/check_design.sh mine
