# System tasks/functions banned outright, regardless of context (unlike
# BehavioralValidator's blanket "calls must be constant expressions" check,
# this is a targeted, defense-in-depth list aimed specifically at:
#   - file I/O ($fopen/$fclose/$fgets/$fscanf/$fread/$fdisplay/$fwrite,
#     $readmemb/$readmemh/$writememb/$writememh): stock iverilog honors
#     arbitrary filesystem paths here, and the Dockerfile ships this whole
#     repo (including every project's reference/ solution RTL) into every
#     built grading image, so unrestricted file I/O in a submission is a
#     reference-solution exfiltration vector (read arbitrary reference/*.v
#     via $fopen/$readmemh and surface it in Gradescope-visible test output,
#     or exfiltrate via $writememh/$fwrite to a location an attacker can
#     later retrieve).
#   - simulation-control ($finish/$stop/$system): can truncate a
#     testbench's own simulation before its failure markers print (see
#     compile_and_run_project2_tb's docstring in submit.py for the related,
#     already-fixed rogue-top-level-module variant of this), or ($system)
#     shell out to the grading container outright.
# Detected via CallExpression.isSystemCall (True only for a genuine
# `$name(...)` system task/function call -- confirmed False, with
# subroutineName exactly matching the plain, unprefixed identifier, for an
# ordinary user-defined function/task call) combined with subroutineName
# (e.g. "$finish", "$fopen") being in this list.
