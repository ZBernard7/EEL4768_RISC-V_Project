# apply when the value is computed at elaboration and no hardware is emitted
# for it, so these are permitted in a constant expression. The canonical case
# is slicing a flattened array inside a generate loop, `x[32*k +: 32]`, where
# `k` is a genvar: writing that as a variable multiply is impossible, so
# rejecting it rejected the only reasonable way to express the slice.
#
# `===`, `!==`, `==?` and `!=?` deliberately do NOT get this exemption: those
# are about X and wildcard semantics rather than synthesis cost, so a constant
# one is still expressing something that has no hardware meaning.
